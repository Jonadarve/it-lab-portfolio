## Goal
Set up my local lab and GitHub portfolio to start tracking 30+ days of IT projects.

## Tasks Completed

- created Github repo: 'it-lab-portfolio'
- cloned repo locally using Git Bash
- installed VirtualBox
- downloaded windows server and Ubuntu ISOs
- used powershell to check for services

## Notes
- Git bash uses Unix-like paths
- cloning repos: "git clone"
- used power shell to cmdlets such as "Get-Service", "Stop-Service", "Start-Service"
