## IT Home Lab Portfolio

Hi, I'm Jon — this is my public learning portfolio where I document hands-on IT projects that simulate real-world Tier 1–3 Help Desk, Systems Admin, Cybersecurity, and MSP work.

## Goals
- Build and document a 30+ day home lab from scratch
- Develop practical experience with Windows Server, Ubuntu, PowerShell, networking, security tools, and more
- Share progress publicly for accountability and proof-of-skill

## Tools & Platforms Used
- VirtualBox
- Windows Server / Ubuntu
- PowerShell, Sysinternals, Chocolatey
- GitHub for tracking and documentation
- Markdown for logs
- I'll add more as I learn about them

## This repo is a living document. I’ll continue updating it daily.
