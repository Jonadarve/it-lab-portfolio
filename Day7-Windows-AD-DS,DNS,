## PowerShell
- the node I'm currently working...slow system responsivness. Decided to work from Powershell. 
- A lot of fun, and will not be going back. 

## Windows Server Setup continued (ADDS + DNS)
- confirmed PowerShell access
- installed Active Directory Domain Services and DNS server roles
- verified that AD DS and DNS were running using PowerShell

## Used PowerShell to:
- Imported AD module
- Created a new OU called LabUsers
- Created a test user
- Learned about password prompts and fixed user creation syntax
- Corrected SamAccountName misunderstanding
- Deleted and recreated user properly
- verified user creation and permissions
- Understood default users like "krbtgt"
